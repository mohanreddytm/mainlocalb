# GrowthProAI – Mini Business Dashboard

This project is built for the GrowthProAI internship assignment. It’s a small full-stack web app that shows how a local business might view its SEO headline, rating, and reviews. The app is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile.

## What it Does

On the homepage, you’ll see a simple form with two fields: **Business Name** and **Location**. When you fill both fields and click the submit button:

- The form sends the data to the backend
- You’ll see a loading spinner for a moment
- Then, a card appears below with:
  - A simulated Google rating (like 4.4★)
  - Number of reviews (random number)
  - A unique SEO-style headline (generated by backend)

There's also a button labeled **"Regenerate SEO Headline"**. When clicked, it only changes the headline using a new one from the backend — other values stay the same.

If you try to submit the **same inputs again**, a small warning popup appears at the top of the page letting you know that the same request was just made recently. This helps avoid sending repeated identical requests.
